What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.004221 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.097817 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 109.996299 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed more than 5 minutes.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.012115 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.421693 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 80.348153 seconds.

following is n/a unfourtunately :
The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed ________ seconds.
